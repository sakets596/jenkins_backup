This option can be used to send the sounds to a remote *NIX machine.<br/>
For example, this command will normally allow sounds to be played on a remote Linux machine:<br/>
<pre>    ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt; play - </pre>
<br/>NOTE: An ssh command must not require a password. To allow this command to authenticate, put the public key of the Jenkins machine on the remote host.
